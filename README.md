Right after Gothic Online was officially suspended, I took the chance to download and save the original files, projects and source codes, that the team posted on the official website of Gothic Online.
I will provide the original untouched files to all freely, you can download the files of your choice immediately through the buttons at the website.

Huge thanks and respect to Sative and Bimbol. They have build the projects from the scratch and it is their work. I will just share it to all interested future developers and users.
